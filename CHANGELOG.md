## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Requirements, task plan, design notes (Inkwell-based) and agent instructions for v1.
- Scaffold (T00): toolbar button and "Planner: open" command open an empty Planner;
  Escape and Close hide it. `@logseq/libs` ^0.3.4.
- Live probe (T01): `npm run probe` records tag schema, node, task-ref, date, `DB.onChanged`
  and closed-value write shapes as fixtures; findings in `docs/probes.md`.
- Theme (T02): `src/ui/theme.ts` mirrors the host mode onto `<html class="dark">` and resolves host
  tokens into `--pl-*` (shui channels in `hsl()`, hover must differ from float); re-resolved on
  theme and mode change, and again 250 ms and 1000 ms later (the host's stylesheet load is not
  observable), last resolve wins. `src/ui/theme.css` holds Inkwell defaults and the base component styles.
- Schema discovery (T03): `src/core/schema.ts` lists tags as a tree (built-in vs own, parents via
  `extends`) with date/DateTime and choice properties including inherited ones, and each choice's
  closed values with the checkbox flag and Canceled-by-ident; `datascriptQuery` added to `src/sdk.ts`.
- Nodes and tasks (T04): `src/core/queries.ts` loads the nodes of a tag (extending tags on or off) and
  the #Task blocks that reference them; `src/core/normalize.ts` maps Date values (journal page
  `journal-day`) and DateTime values (epoch ms, injectable zone offset) to local `YYYY-MM-DD` / `HH:MM`
  and choice values to the tag's closed values.
